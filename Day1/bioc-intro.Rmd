# About R

If you haven't done so already, you can check out our [R crash course](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-crash-course/) for an overview of wh R is great and some of the basic syntax. Here are some great examples of people that have used R to do cool stuff with data

- [Facebook](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2010/12/analysis-of-facebook-status-updates.html),
- [google](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/05/google-using-r-to-analyze-effectiveness-of-tv-ads.html),
- [Microsoft](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/05/microsoft-uses-r-for-xbox-matchmaking.html) (who recently [invested](http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/01/23/microsoft-acquire-revolution-analytics-help-customers-find-big-data-value-advanced-statistical-analysis/) in a commerical provider of R)
- The [New York Times](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/03/how-the-new-york-times-uses-r-for-data-visualization.html).
- [Buzzfeed](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/12/buzzfeed-uses-r-for-data-journalism.html) use R for some of their serious articles and have made the code [publically available](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2016-04-federal-surveillance-planes/analysis.html)
- The [New Zealand Tourist Board](https://mbienz.shinyapps.io/tourism_dashboard_prod/) have R running in the background of their website
- [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/using-r-packages-and-education-to-scale-data-science-at-airbnb-906faa58e12d)
- [The BBC](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/music-festivals) makes code available for some of their stories (e.g. gender bias in music festivals)


R's role in promoting reproducible research cannot be overstated.

Two Biostatiscians (later termed '*Forensic Bioinformaticians*') from M.D. Anderson used R extensively during their re-analysis and investigation of a Clinical Prognostication paper from Duke. The subsequent [scandal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5sZTNPMQRM) put Reproducible Research at the forefront of everyone's mind.

Keith Baggerly's talk on the subject is highly-recommended.

# About the Bioconductor project

![](http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif)


Established in 2001 as a means of distributing tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data in R. Initially focused on microarrays, but now has many tools for NGS data

- primary processing of NGS data nearly-always done in other languages
    + R is extensively-used for visualisation and interpretation once data are in manageable form

On the [Bioconductor website](www.bioconductor.org),. you will find

- Installation instructions
- [Course Materials](http://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/)
- [Support forum](https://support.bioconductor.org/)
    + a means of communicating with developers and power-users
- [Example datasets](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___ExperimentData)
- [Annotation Resources](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___AnnotationData)
- Conferences
    + upcoming conference in Cambridge - December 2017
    

For this session, we will introduce the Bioconductor project as a means of analysing high-throughput data
