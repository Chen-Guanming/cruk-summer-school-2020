# Overview

High-throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) can routinely produce massive amounts of data. These technologies allow us to describe all variants in a genome or to detect the whole set of transcripts that are present in a cell or tissue. However, such datasets pose new challenges in the way the data have to be analyzed, annotated and interpreted which are not trivial and are daunting to the wet-lab biologist. This course covers state-of-the-art and best-practice tools for NGS RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data analysis, which are of major relevance in todayâ€™s genomic and gene expression studies. 

# Audience

Enthusiastic and motivated wet-lab biologists who want to gain more of an understanding of NGS data and eventually progress to analysing their own data

# Pre-requisites

The course will include a great deal of hands-on work in R and at the command line. In order for you to make the most of the course we strongly recommend that you take an introductory course, or have sufficient experience in the following areas:

- R
 - Unix
 - Introductory statistics

# Instructors


# Aims
During this course you will learn about:-

- To provide an understanding of how aligned sequencing reads, genome sequences and genomic regions are represented in R.
- To encourage confidence in reading sequencing reads into R, performing quality assessment and executing standard pipelines for (bulk) RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analysis 
- Analysis of transcription factor (TF) and epigenomic (histone mark) ChIP-seq data 
- Recent advances in single-cell sequencing and analysis

# Objectives
After the course you should be able to:-


- Know what tools are available in Bioconductor for HTS analysis and understand the basic object-types that are utilised.
- Process and quality control short read sequencing data 
- Given a set of gene identifiers, find out whereabouts in the genome they are located, and vice-versa 
- Produce a list of differentially expressed genes from an RNA-Seq experiment.
- Import a set of ChIP-Seq peaks and investigate their biological context.
